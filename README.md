# A Light In The Dark
This project was inspired by the GWC 2025 SIP Game Jam prompt "what gives you hope".

### Game Rules and Procedures
- Move your cursor to collect all the smiles. These will give you one point if collected. 
- Move your cursor to collect all the big grins. These will give you two points if collected. 
- Move your cursor to stay clear of all the frowns. These will take away one point if collected. 
- Move your cursor to stay clear of the neutral faces. These will neither give nor take any points.
- All faces move quickly, so be sure to collect them before they disappear again.
