# A Light In The Dark
This pgame is called "A Light In the Dark". This project was inspired by the GWC 2025 SIP Game Jam prompt "what gives you hope".
For me, the saying "a light in the dark" often is used to represent hope, and to keep going no matter what.

In this game, the player has to collect all the happy smiles to increase their light and make the room bright again. There are obstacles in the way that will dim the light and prevent the player from reaching the desired score. The player has to have hope and believe in themselves to collect all the rapidly moving smiles and stay clear of the fast moving frowns to increase their light and make their room bright again.

Something I learned while doing this project was adding sound and images to sprites. I also learned how to do a replay button with a boolean function so that the game can be played over and over by the player. Furthermore, I learned to always be careful with how you set your sprites and booleans so that the game doesn't glitch. 

### Game Rules and Procedures
- Move your cursor to collect all the smiles. These will give you one point if collected. 
- Move your cursor to collect all the big grins. These will give you two points if collected. 
- Move your cursor to stay clear of all the frowns. These will take away one point if collected. 
- Move your cursor to stay clear of the neutral faces. These will neither give nor take any points.
- All faces move quickly, so be sure to collect them before they disappear again.  
- Collect 10 points to see the room bright again.
- Have fun!
